# 💰 Digital Finance Literacy Assistant

An AI-powered virtual assistant developed during the **IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies**.  
This project leverages **IBM Watson Assistant on IBM Cloud** to promote financial literacy, ensure safe digital transactions, and prevent online fraud.

Ensuring safe, inclusive, and accessible financial literacy is challenging.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Educate users about **safe UPI practices**
- Provide **budgeting and saving tips**
- Share **loan and interest rate information**
- Enable **fraud reporting awareness**
